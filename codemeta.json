    "description": "This is the code associated with the paper title \"Publicly Available Imaging Datasets for Age-related Macular Degeneration: Evaluation according to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible (FAIR) Principles\". Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss among older adults, affects more than 200 million people worldwide. In this paper, We evaluated openly available AMD-related datasets containing optical coherence tomography (OCT) data against the FAIR principles. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook developed to analyze data for the paper and generate figures.",
